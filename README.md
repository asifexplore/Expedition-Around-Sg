Year in, year out, millions of tourists visit Singapore. In an era, where smartphones play a big part in everyone's lives, an application to act as a guide around Singapore fails to exist. Existing guide applications for Singapore mainly focuses on mainstream tourist attractions like Orchard Road etc. Such applications fail to show Singapore's heritage and culture from a different perspective.

Expedition around Singapore is an application which promotes ordinary citizens, foreigners, and tourists to go on an expedition around Singapore. It also promotes blogging of these expeditions and sharing it with others.
